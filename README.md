# Biomedical-Image-Processing
This project focuses on biomedical image processing to analyze pixel intensity distributions and perform image segmentation using Otsuâ€™s thresholding. The extracted data is stored in a CSV file for further analysis. The program processes grayscale images, computes histograms and cumulative distribution functions (CDFs), and separates the foreground and background for better visualization.
